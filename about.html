        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Kendall Smith. I am originally from Thomson,Ga and moved to Kennesaw, Ga in 2019. I originally moved here to pursue a career in Biology,
            but quickly realized I was more interested in a career in Cybersecurity. I am 23 years old and will be graduating with a Cybersecurity degree this spring. This portfolio will delve into
            my personal and proffesional intrest and also hit on a few of my favorite hobbies to truly show who I am. 

        </p>
        <p> As far as my background goes, I am from a very small town that most people never really hear of. I grew up mainly playing recreation sports, readding books, hanging out with friends, and playing my favorite video games.
            I still have these same hobbies for the most part but now I take a lot of time to work and study for my classes. My favorite hobby growing up was definetly playing video games. My work background is fairly basic 
            in my humble opinion. My first job was at a fast-food restraunt and I worked there for most of my highschool career. When my college carreer began, I started taking an interest in management positions and became the assistant manager
            at a local planet fitess where I worked for a few years. I transitioned into a job at Public Storage as a property manager which is where I am currently employed. 
        </p>

        <p> My goals are to continue my education and seek certifications that will help me establish a job in Cybersecurity. I am currently working to get numerous certifcations in different categories that will pair well with my cybersecurity degree. 
            These categories consist of cloud security, compliance and privacy, and other aspects of cybersecurity. I hope to find a entry level job out of college and quickly begin my career.
